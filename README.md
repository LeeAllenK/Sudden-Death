The name of the game is SUDDEN DEATH!! Each player is dealt 7 cards from a deck. Once the cards are dealt, each player tries to beat the card on top of the deck. If neither player can beat the top card, a 'Sudden Death' round is triggered. In this round, players can choose one card from their hand to play in an attempt to win the round. The game continues until a player has an empty hand or the deck is exhausted.

 Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,React <br/><br/>
 React was used for building the user interface and managing state. Implementing react hooks of useState and useEffect to manage game state and update dependencies effiiciently. The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly. CSS is used for styling and creating a visually appealing design, while JavaScript handles the game logic and interactivity.

 <h1 class="heading-element" dir="auto">Optimizations:</h1>
 Currently this app doesn't have a sign-in page that will be my next task. I will ensure the game is playable across all playable devices. Although an amazing app not having a database to store game data will be priority. My final focus will be on building this app for mobile using React-Native.

 I enhanced knowledge of game development principles, including handling user interactions and updating the game state in real-time. I will continue to integrate API's to fetch and manipulate data. I also gained a deeper understanding of managing state, with complex logic.
